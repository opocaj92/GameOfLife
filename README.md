# GameOfLife
## A simple web version of the Conway's Game of Life

### How it works
It's written using HTML5+CSS3 for the UI and pure JavaScript (no framework) for the logic of the game. The board is represented with an HTML table, and each cell has an unique ID. At the beginning, you can draw your own setting for the initial population (the board is 40x40) by clicking on the cell you want to start as alive. When you have finished, you can click the Start button to see how your population is going to evolve. The Game of Life version implemented is the original one, without loop conditions on the border.
